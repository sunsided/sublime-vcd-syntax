# Value Change Dump syntax file for Sublime Text 2

Syntax highlighting for ASCII [VCD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_change_dump) files as defined in the Verilog standard (as least as far I could reverse-engineer it).

To install, simply drop the `VCD.tmLanguage` in your user packages path or clone the repository into your main packages path (see `Preferences, Browse Packages`).
